---

# Slide 3: What is Agent Mode?

## GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

**Traditional Copilot:**
- Line-by-line completions
- Suggests code as you type
- Limited context awareness

**Agent Mode:**
- Conversational AI assistant
- Understands entire project context
- Can generate multiple files
- Iterates on requirements
- Reads and modifies existing code and files

**Think of it as:** A pair programmer who never sleeps!

---

# Slide 4: The Challenge

## Software Development is Complex

**Traditional Challenges:**
- Writing boilerplate code
- Maintaining consistency across files
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Translating requirements to code
- Writing tests
- Following team conventions

**AI Can Help With:**
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ Pattern consistency
- ✅ Code exploration
- ✅ Requirements translation
- ✅ Test automation
- ✅ Convention adherence

---

# Slide 5: Requirements-First Development

## The Core Principle

```
📋 REQUIREMENTS → 🏗️ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN → 💻 CODE
```

**Why this order matters:**

1. **Clarity First:** Know WHAT before HOW
2. **Better AI Results:** Clear requirements = better code
3. **Documentation:** Requirements serve as living docs
4. **Validation:** Easy to verify correctness
5. **Collaboration:** Team alignment on goals

**Anti-Pattern:** 🚫 Jump straight to coding

---

# Slide 6: The Three Essential Documents

## Your AI Development Toolkit

### 1. **AGENTS.md** - The Foundation
*Project conventions and patterns*
- Coding standards
- Architecture decisions
- Naming conventions
- Technology stack

### 2. **Product Requirements** - The WHAT
*What we're building and why*
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements
- Success metrics

### 3. **Implementation Plan** - The HOW
*Technical approach*
- Architecture design
- Component breakdown
- Technology choices
- Testing strategy

---

# Slide 7: AGENTS.md - Your AI Guidebook

## What is AGENTS.md?

A markdown file that tells AI assistants about your project's conventions.

**Purpose:**
- Persistent context for AI
- Project "source of truth"
- Reduces repetitive explanations
- Ensures consistency
- **Defines human-reviewable work units**

**Lives in:** Project root directory (`/AGENTS.md`)

**🌟 The Magic:** GitHub Copilot and other AI agents **automatically read** AGENTS.md when it exists!
- No need to reference it in every prompt
- Agent loads it as context automatically
- Works in the background for every interaction

**Contents:**
```markdown
# Project: Task Manager CLI
## Tech Stack
- C# 12, .NET 8.0
- System.CommandLine for CLI

## Conventions
- Use file-scoped namespaces
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Repository pattern for data access

## Work Unit Guidelines
- Max reviewable change: 1 feature or 300 lines
- Break large features into smaller PRs
- Each unit should be testable independently
```

**Think of it as:** Instructions you'd give a new team member

**💡 Pro Tip:** Ask the agent to help you create AGENTS.md!
```
"Help me create an AGENTS.md for a C# .NET 8.0 CLI application.
What sections should I include?"
```

---

# Slide 8: When to Create AGENTS.md

## Greenfield (New Projects)

✅ Create AGENTS.md **FIRST**
- Define conventions upfront
- Guide initial code generation
- Establish patterns from day one
- **Agent auto-loads it for every interaction**

**Example:**
```
1. Create AGENTS.md with tech stack
2. Write requirements
3. Ask agent: "Generate project structure"
   (No need to say "following AGENTS.md" - it's automatic!)
```

## Brownfield (Existing Projects)

✅ Create AGENTS.md after **EXPLORING**
- Observe existing patterns
- Document what's already there
- Note areas of consistency
- **Once created, agent uses it automatically**

**Example:**
```
1. Explore codebase
2. Document observed patterns in AGENTS.md
3. Ask agent to implement features
   (It will follow existing style automatically)
```

**Key Insight:** You don't need to say "follow AGENTS.md" in every prompt.
If `/AGENTS.md` exists, Copilot reads it automatically!

---

# Slide 9: Product Requirements

## Defining the WHAT and WHY

**Focus on:**
- ✅ User needs and goals
- ✅ Functional requirements
- ✅ Acceptance criteria
- ✅ Edge cases and validation
- ✅ Non-functional requirements

**Avoid:**
- 🚫 Implementation details
- 🚫 Technology choices
- 🚫 Code structure
- 🚫 Database schemas

**Example Requirement:**
```markdown
## REQ-001: Add Task
User can add a new task with a title and optional description.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Task must have non-empty title
- Title limited to 200 characters
- Description is optional
- System generates unique ID
- Task initially marked as "Pending"
```

---

# Slide 10: Implementation Plan

## Defining the HOW

**Focus on:**
- ✅ Technical architecture
- ✅ Component design
- ✅ Data models and storage
- ✅ Technology stack
- ✅ Testing approach
- ✅ Error handling strategy
- ✅ **Breaking into prioritizable work units**

**Critical: Think in Features, Not Monoliths**

Don't implement everything at once. Break features into:
- **Reviewable chunks** (1 feature or ~300 lines of code)
- **Independently testable units**
- **Prioritizable work items** (can ship incrementally)
- **Logical phases** (Phase 1: Core, Phase 2: Polish)

**Example:**
```markdown
## Architecture
- Presentation Layer: CLI (System.CommandLine)
- Business Logic: TaskService
- Data Access: TaskRepository (JSON)

## Implementation Phases
Phase 1 (High Priority): Add & List tasks
Phase 2 (Medium): Complete & Delete tasks  
Phase 3 (Low): Search & Filter

Each phase = 1 reviewable PR
- Storage: ~/.taskmanager/tasks.json

## Error Handling
- ArgumentException for user input errors (exit 1)
- IOException for file errors (exit 2)
- Display user-friendly messages
```

---

# MODULE A: Prerequisites & Setup

---

# Slide 11: Environment Check

## Let's Verify Your Setup

### Required Tools:

**1. Visual Studio Code**
```bash
code --version
# Should show: 1.85.0 or later
```

**2. .NET SDK**
```bash
dotnet --version
# Should show: 8.0.x
```

**3. GitHub Copilot**
- Open VS Code
- Look for Copilot icon in sidebar
- Should show "Copilot Active"

**4. GitHub EMU Authentication**
- Sign in to GitHub
- Verify enterprise organization access

---

# Slide 12: GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

## Activating Agent Mode

**Method 1: Chat Panel**
1. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I)
2. Type `@workspace` to engage agent mode
3. Ask questions about your project

**Method 2: Inline Chat**
1. Press Ctrl+I (Cmd+I on Mac) in editor
2. Agent has access to current file context

**Method 3: Quick Chat**
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
2. General questions without file context

**Try it now:**
```
@workspace What files are in this workspace?
```

---

# Slide 13: Effective Prompting

## Getting Good Results from Agents

### ✅ Good Prompts:

**1. Ask Questions First:**
```
✅ "What information do you need to create a task management service?"
✅ "What conventions should I document in AGENTS.md for a C# CLI app?"
✅ "Are there any edge cases I should consider for this feature?"
```
**Agents can clarify requirements and suggest best practices!**

**2. Be Specific with Details:**
```
❌ "Create a task class"
✅ "Create a Task class with Id (Guid), Title (string, required), 
    Description (string, optional), Status (enum: Pending/Complete), 
    and CreatedAt (DateTime). Follow conventions in AGENTS.md"
```

**3. Provide Context:**
```
❌ "Add error handling"
✅ "Add error handling to TaskService.AddTaskAsync that validates 
    title is not empty and throws ArgumentException with clear 
    message. See error handling section in AGENTS.md"
```

**4. Show Examples (Few-Shot Learning):**
```
✅ "Here's how I want the output formatted:
    [ID] Task Title (Status)
    Now implement the list command to match this format."
```

**5. Break Down Complex Tasks:**
```
✅ "Let's implement authentication step by step:
    1. First create the User model
    2. Then create AuthService
    3. Finally add login command"
```

**6. Request Explanations:**
```
✅ "Implement X and explain your approach and any tradeoffs"
```

**Reference Documents:**
```
✅ "Generate TaskService following the architecture in 
    IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md and conventions in AGENTS.md"
```

# Slide 14: The AI Development Progression

## Four Levels of AI-Assisted Development

### Level 1: **Single-Shot Prompts** 🎯
*"Create a calculator function"*
- Quick and easy
- Generic results
- No context
- Inconsistent patterns

### Level 2: **Multi-Step Iterations** 🔄
*"Create calculator... now add validation... now add tests"*
- Better refinement
- Still reactive
- Context lost between prompts
- Time-consuming back-and-forth

### Level 3: **Context-Aware Development** 📂
*"Create calculator following AGENTS.md conventions"*
- Consistent patterns
- Project-aware
- Reusable context
- Still ad-hoc requirements

### Level 4: **Spec-First Development** 🏆
*"Implement calculator from REQUIREMENTS.md using AGENTS.md"*
- **Clear requirements**
- **Production-ready code**
- **Complete documentation**
- **Maintainable & testable**

**Today we focus on Level 4**

---

# Slide 15: Demo - The Progression

## Let's See the Difference

**Same Task, Different Approaches:**

### Demo 1: Single-Shot 🎯
```
Prompt: "Create a function to add two numbers"
```
*[Show result: Basic function, no validation, no tests]*

### Demo 2: With Context 📂
```
Prompt: "Create an Add method in Calculator class 
following AGENTS.md conventions"
```
*[Show result: Better structure, follows patterns, still incomplete]*

### Demo 3: Spec-First 🏆
```
Prompt: "Implement Calculator.Add from requirements/calculator.md
following AGENTS.md conventions"
```
*[Show result: Complete with validation, error handling, tests, docs]*

**Key Insight:** Investment in requirements pays off exponentially

---

# Slide 16: Why Spec-First Wins

## The Benefits Are Clear

### Single-Shot Problems:
❌ Ambiguous requirements
❌ Missing edge cases
❌ No validation
❌ Inconsistent patterns
❌ No tests
❌ Poor documentation
❌ Requires extensive revision

### Spec-First Advantages:
✅ **Clarity:** Everyone knows what to build
✅ **Quality:** Edge cases defined upfront
✅ **Consistency:** Patterns documented in AGENTS.md
✅ **Completeness:** Tests and validation included
✅ **Efficiency:** Less back-and-forth
✅ **Maintainability:** Clear documentation
✅ **Collaboration:** Team alignment from start

### Time Investment:
**Single-shot:** 5 min prompt + 2 hours fixing ⇒ **2h 5min**  
**Spec-first:** 20 min requirements + 30 min implementation ⇒ **50 min**

**Spec-first is faster AND better quality!**

# Slide 18: Common Mistakes to Avoid

## Agent Pitfalls

### ❌ **Mistake 1: No Context**
"Write me a service class"
→ Agent doesn't know your patterns

### ❌ **Mistake 2: Skipping Requirements**
Jump straight to "generate code"
→ Unclear requirements = bad code

### ❌ **Mistake 3: Not Creating AGENTS.md**
Agent reinvents patterns each time
→ Inconsistent code

### ❌ **Mistake 4: Not Asking Questions**
Assume you know everything upfront
→ Miss important considerations

### ❌ **Mistake 5: Accepting First Result**
Use generated code without review
→ Bugs and poor design

### ✅ **Best Practice:**
**ASK QUESTIONS** → Requirements → Plan → AGENTS.md (ask agent to help!) → Iterate with Agent → Review → Test

**Remember:** The agent is your pair programmer - have a conversation!

# Slide 24: Common Greenfield Patterns

## Patterns That Work Well

### Pattern 1: Layer-by-Layer
```
Models → Services → Data Access → Presentation
```
Build from inside out

### Pattern 2: Feature-by-Feature
```
Add Task (end-to-end) → List Tasks → Complete → Delete
```
Vertical slices of functionality

### Pattern 3: Test-Driven
```
Requirements → Tests → Implementation
```
Write tests first, generate code to pass them

**For Today's Lab:** Use Layer-by-Layer approach
- Models are foundation
- Services use models
- CLI uses services

# MODULE C: Brownfield Development

---

# Slide 25: Brownfield Overview

## Working with Existing Code

**Brownfield Definition:**
- Existing codebase
- Established patterns (good or bad)
- Technical debt
- Must maintain compatibility

**Challenges:**
- Understanding existing code
- Following inconsistent patterns
- Avoiding breaking changes
- Balancing old and new

**AI Advantages:**
- ✅ Quick code exploration
- ✅ Pattern detection
- ✅ Consistent with existing style
- ✅ Test generation for safety

---

# Slide 26: Brownfield Workflow

## The Process (Different from Greenfield!)

```
1. EXPLORE CODEBASE (15 min)
   └─ Read code, understand patterns, run existing features

2. CREATE AGENTS.MD (15 min)
   └─ Document OBSERVED patterns (not ideal ones)

3. WRITE REQUIREMENTS (10 min)
   └─ New feature specs, impact on existing code

4. CREATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (8 min)
   └─ How to integrate with existing architecture

5. IMPLEMENT WITH AGENTS (12 min)
   └─ Modify existing code, add new features

6. TEST & VERIFY (10 min)
   └─ New features work, old features still work
```

**Key Difference:** Explore FIRST, then document

---

# Slide 27: Creating AGENTS.md for Existing Code

## Document What EXISTS, Not What You Want

### ✅ Observe and Document:
```markdown
## Observed Patterns
- Services use repository pattern
- Methods are NOT async (legacy design)
- Error handling uses exceptions
- Models in /Models folder
- No dependency injection (manual instantiation)

## Known Issues
- No input validation in CLI layer
- No logging
- Hardcoded file paths

## Areas to Preserve
- Existing API contracts
- File locations
- Command names
```

### ❌ Don't Write Ideal State:
```markdown
## Conventions (WRONG for brownfield)
- All I/O should be async ← Not current state!
- Use dependency injection ← Doesn't exist yet!
```

**Agent needs reality, not aspirations**

---

# Slide 28: Brownfield Best Practices

## Extending Existing Code

### ✅ DO:
- Match existing naming conventions
- Follow established patterns
- Test backward compatibility
- Add features incrementally
- Document deviations in AGENTS.md

### ❌ DON'T:
- Rewrite working code unnecessarily
- Introduce new patterns without team buy-in
- Break existing APIs
- Mix styles (half old, half new in same file)
- Ignore technical debt (but don't fix all at once)

### 🤔 When to Improve:
**Small fixes:** Go ahead (typos, obvious bugs)  
**Pattern changes:** Discuss with team first  
**Major refactors:** Separate ticket/PR

---

# Slide 32: Handling Technical Debt

## What About Bad Code?

**During Lab (Today):**
- ❌ Don't fix everything
- ✅ Document issues in AGENTS.md
- ✅ Match existing style for now
- ✅ Focus on feature delivery

**In Real Projects:**

**Option 1: Boy Scout Rule**
"Leave code better than you found it"
- Small improvements while adding features
- Fix nearby issues
- Gradual improvement

**Option 2: Separate Refactoring**
- File technical debt tickets
- Prioritize with product owner
- Dedicated refactoring sprints

**Option 3: Document and Move On**
- Note in AGENTS.md: "Known Issue"
- Add TODO comments
- Focus on new value

**Balance:** Ship features vs. improve quality

# Slide 36: Effective Prompt Patterns

## Prompts That Work

### Pattern 1: Role + Context + Task + Constraints
```
"You are a C# expert. In the TaskService class, add a method 
GetTasksByStatusAsync that filters tasks by status. Follow the 
async patterns in AGENTS.md and use IReadOnlyList return type 
like other methods."
```

### Pattern 2: Chain of Thought
```
"Let's implement user authentication step by step. For each step,
explain your reasoning before writing code:
1. What should the User model contain?
2. How should passwords be stored securely?
3. What validation is needed?"
```

### Pattern 3: Reference + Generate
```
"Generate a TaskRepository class following the repository 
pattern described in IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md. Use 
System.Text.Json for serialization as specified in AGENTS.md."
```

### Pattern 4: Example + Replicate (Few-Shot)
```
"Add a 'delete' command to Program.cs following the same 
pattern as the 'complete' command. Parse task ID from args 
and call TaskService.DeleteTaskAsync."
```

### Pattern 5: Negative Constraints
```
"Implement task filtering. DO NOT use LINQ. DO NOT load all 
tasks into memory. Use streaming approach."
```

### Pattern 6: Iterative Refinement
```
First: "Draft a solution for task filtering"
Review output...
Then: "Good, but add caching to improve performance"
Review...
Finally: "Add logging for debugging"
```

# Slide 37: Advanced Prompt Techniques

## Level Up Your Prompting

### Technique 1: Zero-Shot → Few-Shot → Many-Shot

**Zero-Shot** (no examples):
```
"Create error handling for the API"
```

**Few-Shot** (1-2 examples):
```
"Create error handling for the API. Here's how I handle 
validation errors:
try { ValidateInput(); }
catch (ValidationException ex) { return BadRequest(ex.Message); }

Follow this pattern for all error types."
```

**Many-Shot** (multiple examples for complex patterns):
Use when pattern is non-obvious or has many variations

### Technique 2: Constrained Generation
```
"Generate only the method signature, not the implementation"
"Write tests only, I'll implement the code"
"Provide 3 alternative approaches without code"
```

### Technique 3: Self-Critique
```
"Implement task deletion. After you're done, critique your 
solution: What edge cases might you have missed? What could 
be more robust?"
```

### Technique 4: Persona/Role Assignment
```
"As a security expert, review this authentication code and 
identify vulnerabilities"

"As a performance engineer, suggest optimizations for this 
data access layer"
```

### Technique 5: Incremental Context
```
Start: "Create a Task model"
Add: "Now add validation to the Task model"
Add: "Now create a service that uses this model"
```
Build up complexity gradually

---

# Slide 38: When AI Struggles
```
"Add a 'delete' command to Program.cs following the same 
pattern as the 'complete' command. Parse task ID from args 
and call TaskService.DeleteTaskAsync."
```

### Pattern 4: Problem + Constraints
```
"Fix the null reference exception in GetTaskById when no 
matching task is found. Return null instead of throwing, 
and handle this in the CLI by displaying 'Task not found'."
```

---

# Slide 39: When AI Struggles

## Knowing the Limits

### Situations Where AI Needs Help:

**Complex Business Logic:**
- Multi-step calculations
- Domain-specific rules
- Edge cases with many conditions
→ *Break into smaller prompts*

# Slide 40: MCP Servers - Extended Integration (Optional)

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**What is MCP?**
Extends Copilot to connect with external systems like GitHub Issues and Azure DevOps.

**Capabilities:**
- 📋 Read/write GitHub Issues
- ✅ Create/update Azure DevOps work items
- 🔗 Link code to requirements automatically
- 📊 Generate traceability reports
- 🤖 Automate task management

**Why Use MCP?**
- Reduce context switching
- Maintain traceability
- Automate project management
- Keep work items in sync with code

**Example:**
```
"Create GitHub issues from requirements/auth.md and label
them as 'feature' in milestone v1.0"

"Update ADO task #12345 to 'In Progress' and add comment
with implementation notes"
```

---

# Slide 41: MCP Workflow Example

## Automated Requirements to Tasks

### Without MCP (Manual):
```
1. Write requirements document
2. Open GitHub/ADO in browser
3. Manually create issues/tasks
4. Copy requirements text
5. Set labels, milestones, assignments
6. Switch back to VS Code
7. Start coding
8. Switch back to update status
9. Link commits manually
```
**Time:** 15-20 minutes overhead per feature

### With MCP (Automated):
```
1. Write requirements document
2. Ask agent: "Create work items from requirements/auth.md"
   → Agent creates all issues/tasks
3. Start coding
4. Agent automatically updates status as you work
5. Agent links commits to work items
```
**Time:** 2-3 minutes overhead per feature

**Savings:** 75% reduction in project management overhead!

---

# Appendix B: Advanced Prompt Techniques

## Pro-Level Prompting

### Technique 1: Chain of Thought
```
"Let's implement TaskService step by step:
1. First, create the interface with method signatures
2. Then, implement AddTaskAsync with validation
3. Next, add GetAllTasksAsync with repository call
4. Finally, add error handling for each method"
```

### Technique 2: Few-Shot Learning
```
"Here's how I implemented the add command:
[paste example code]

Now implement the delete command following the same pattern."
```

### Technique 3: Constraint Emphasis
```
"IMPORTANT: Must preserve backward compatibility.
DO NOT change existing method signatures.
Add new overload methods instead."
```

### Technique 4: Iterative Refinement
```
First prompt: "Create Book model"
Review result...
Second prompt: "Add validation to Title property"
Review result...
Third prompt: "Add ISBN format validation"
```
